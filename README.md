# CanDrivR: A Machine Learning Model to Predict Driver Mutations in Cancer Genomes

## Introduction and Overview
CanDrivR is a machine learning tool that we have developed to predict whether a single nucleotide variant is a cancer-driver (e.g., whether it is liekly to be pathogenic in a cancer context). This repository contains all of the code used to experiment with and optimise CanDrivR. It contains three main directories: Data, Models, and Optimisation. The "Data" directory contains all of the scripts that were used to clean training and test data. The data cleaned in these scripts are subsequently used as input for DrivR-Base, a tool that we have developed to extract features for CanDrivR machine learning models. The "Models" directory contains all of the models that were used to experiment with the data, and to decide which models performs best for our data. The "Optimisation" directory contains all of the scripts used to optimise our model. This inculdes scripts that optimise training dataset sizes, feature selection, and hyperparameter tuning.
